/**
 * \class Extensible
 * \brief Base class to manage private data through a d-pointer
 *
 * The Extensible class provides a base class to implement the
 * <a href="https://wiki.qt.io/D-Pointer">d-pointer</a> design pattern (also
 * known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_pointer">opaque pointer</a>
 * or <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl">pImpl idiom</a>).
 * It helps creating public classes that can be extended without breaking their
 * ABI. Such classes store their private data in a separate private data object,
 * referenced by a pointer in the public class (hence the name d-pointer).
 *
 * Classes that follow this design pattern are referred herein as extensible
 * classes. To be extensible, a class PublicClass shall:
 *
 * - inherit from the Extensible class or from another extensible class
 * - invoke the LIBCAMERA_DECLARE_PRIVATE() macro at the very top of the class
 *   definition
 * - define a private data class named PublicClass::Private that inherits from
 *   the Private data class of the base class
 * - invoke the LIBCAMERA_DECLARE_PUBLIC() macro at the very top of the Private
 *   data class definition
 * - pass a pointer to a newly allocated Private data object to the constructor
 *   of the base class
 *
 * Additionally, if the PublicClass is not final, it shall expose one or more
 * constructors that takes a pointer to a Private data instance, to be used by
 * derived classes.
 *
 * The Private class is fully opaque to users of the libcamera public API.
 * Internally, it can be kept private to the implementation of PublicClass, or
 * be exposed to other classes. In the latter case, the members of the Private
 * class need to be qualified with appropriate access specifiers. The
 * PublicClass and Private classes always have full access to each other's
 * protected and private members.
